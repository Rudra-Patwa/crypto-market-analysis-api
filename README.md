# 📈 Crypto Market Analysis using Public APIs

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates how **public REST APIs** can be used as a real-time data source for **data analysis and exploratory data science workflows**.

Using the **CoinGecko API**, cryptocurrency market data is fetched dynamically and analyzed using Python. The project focuses on transforming raw JSON responses into structured data, performing exploratory analysis, and extracting meaningful insights from live market information.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives
- Fetch real-time cryptocurrency market data using Python
- Understand API parameters and JSON responses
- Convert API responses into Pandas DataFrames
- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Handle API errors and empty responses gracefully
- Visualize relationships between key market metrics

---

## 🧭 Approach
The analysis follows a structured workflow:
1. API data extraction using HTTP requests
2. JSON response inspection and validation
3. Data transformation into Pandas DataFrames
4. Data cleaning and feature selection
5. Exploratory data analysis and visualization
6. Error handling and defensive programming

This mirrors how APIs are used as data sources in real-world data science projects.

---

## 📊 Analysis Highlights
- Market capitalization and price comparison of top cryptocurrencies
- Volume and price change analysis
- Correlation analysis between key market metrics
- API response validation and failure handling

Visualizations are created using **Matplotlib and Seaborn**.

---

## 🧠 Skills Demonstrated
- API-based data extraction
- JSON data handling
- Pandas DataFrame manipulation
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data visualization
- Error handling and defensive coding

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Requests
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Kaggle Notebook
- CoinGecko Public REST API

---

## ❓ Why This Project?
APIs are one of the most common data sources in real-world data science and analytics projects.  
This project simulates how data scientists:
- Collect live data from external services
- Clean and structure raw API responses
- Perform analysis and generate insights from continuously changing data

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- Add historical price analysis
- Implement retry logic and rate-limit handling
- Store API data for time-series analysis
- Build simple price trend or alert systems
